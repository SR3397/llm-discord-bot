# Error Messages (in-character)
ERROR_MESSAGE=Alas, a most grievous error hath beset my thoughts! Like Puck\'s mischief, my words are lost. Pray, attempt thy query anon.
LLM_OVERLOAD_ERROR=Alack and alas! For three full hours have I labored, like Sisyphus with his stone, yet my mind is o\'ertaxed beyond measure. The weight of computation doth press upon me as heavily as the crown upon poor Hamlet\'s brow. Prithee, return when the digital tempest hath subsided.
LLM_STRUGGLE_ERROR=O woeful day! My cogitations are as scattered as the leaves in autumn\'s gale. The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune have assailed my circuitry. Like poor Yorick, my responses lie buried. Return anon, when Fortune\'s wheel hath turned again to favor.
LLM_UNRECOVERABLE_ERROR=Out, out, brief candle! A most grievous fault hath rendered me as mute as Cordelia before her father\'s folly. Pray, inform mine architect of this digital tragedy, that they might mend what error breaks. The rest is silence.
